			<p>Welcome to homemade. What does homemade mean to you? Is it something you cook or make for your family or the time with family or smells that build the memories? When I started this homemade food business in january 8, it was with the idea that everything would be made from scratch.  Mainly because of my own memories in the kitchen of cooking with my family</p>
			<p>I hope you have some great memories of homemade food goods, where the scent of fresh food  came from a kitchen with people who loved and cared about you.  This is where homemade becomes a beautiful description of a place in time that we felt loved, or even safe. If you were lucky enough to experience this with someone special, then you know what Iâ€™m talking about. I hope that you feel that way with every order you receive from My Tiffin .</p>
